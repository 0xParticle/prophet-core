# Private ERC20 Resoultion Module | Idea Draft

### VoterData

- bytes32 `commitment` instead of uint256 `numOfVotes` (maybe both?)

### Request Data

- module's request data must add a `commitmentTimeWindow` for users to commit
their votes

- `_timeUntilDeadline` could be renamed to have both `commitmentTimeWindow` and `revealingTimeWindow`

### Create commitment?

`function createCommitment(bytes32 _disputeId, uint256 _numberOfVotes, bytes32 _salt) pure view returns (bytes32 _commitment)`

### Commiting

`function commitVote(bytes32 _requestId, bytes32 _disputeId, bytes32 _commitment)`

- where `_commitment` is the keccak256 hash of `abiEncodePacked(address msg.sender, bytes32 _disputeId, uint256 numberOfVotes, bytes32 salt)`

- all checks done in the public `ERC20ResolutionModule` but checking for `commitmentTimeWindow`

- `votes[_disputeId].push(VoterData({voter: msg.sender, commitment: _commitment, numberOfVotes: 0}))`

- no token transfer

- `emit VoteCommited(msg.sender, _disputeId, _commitment)`

### Revealing

`function revealVote(bytes32 _requestId, bytes32 _disputeId, uint256 _numberOfVotes, bytes32 _salt)`

- check for `revealingTimeWindow`

- check if user has commited and/or revealed a vote

- check that `hash(encode(msg.sender, _disputeId, _numberOfVotes, _salt)) == userVoteData.commitment`

- `totalNumberOfVotes += _numberOfVotes`

- `userVoteData.numberOfVotes = _numberOfVotes` ?

- token transfer from voter to contract

- `emit VoteRevealed(msg.sender, _disputeId, _numberOfVotes)`

### Resolving dispute

The dispute resolution remains the same just checking that `revealingTimeWindow` has ended.

### Questions

- the salt must only be provided at revealing. how will it be computated? where will it be stored?

- users must approve the resolution contract in order to transfer voting tokens. since the amount is not known, how much must the voter approve and when4?
